# cljs.java.time

A Clojurescript library that provides the jsr-310 (java.time) api.

Note: this is not a wrapper library, meaning there are not additional Clojurescript
functions, only what java.time provides. 

Underneath this lib is a pure JS implementation of java.time. This extends that by
adding Clojurescript's equivalence, hash and comparison protocols to the java.time
domain objects, providing externs and having the packages of java.time be mirrored by namespaces.
 
For a Clojure(Script) api that uses this, checkout the cross-platform [tick](https://clojars.org/tick/versions/0.4.0-alpha) (v 0.4+) library
and for tagged literals that read and print these objects, see [time-literals](https://clojars.org/time-literals)

## Usage

get it from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/cljs.java-time) 

```
(require '[java.time :refer [LocalDate]])

(.parse LocalDate "2020-01-01")
```

If you would like to be able to use `=` and `sort` with the java.time objects

```
(require 'cljs.java-time.extend-eq-and-compare)
```

To write cross platform code that calls any getter methods on java.time objects, use the
`cljs.java-time.interop/getter` macro

### Cross Platform Example

```
(ns foo
  (:require
    #?(:cljs [java.time :refer [LocalDate]])
    [time-literals.read-write])
   #?(:clj (:import [java.time LocalDate])))
   
   
  (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01")
  ;=> #time/date"2020-12-01"
  
  (= 
    (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01")
    (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01"))
  ; => true  
```

### Shadow Cljs

The npm library that provides the jsr-310 api is provided via Cljsjs, foreign-libs. To make this work with
Shadow, add the following dependency:

`[thheller/shadow-cljsjs "0.0.16"]`

See [this demo](https://github.com/henryw374/tick-on-shadow-cljs-demo) for more info
